It is a Django web app that quickly compares product details from different eCommerce sites, helping users make informed decisions and save time while shopping online. 

In the realm of online shopping, the abundance of eCommerce platforms often leaves consumers overwhelmed and spending significant time comparing product details across different websites. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to create a Django web application that streamlines the product comparison process. Leveraging technologies such as Beautiful Soup 4 and Scrapy, the platform dynamically scrapes essential product information, including prices, names, ratings, images, and descriptions, from popular eCommerce websites. The goal is to provide users with a centralized hub where they can efficiently compare similar products across diverse online stores. The web application, built with a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporates features such as Django Rest Framework for seamless communication, asynchronous processing for enhanced performance, and user authentication for personalized experiences. The end result is an intuitive and responsive platform that empowers users to make informed decisions, ultimately reducing the time spent on online shopping.
